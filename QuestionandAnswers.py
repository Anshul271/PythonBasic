#Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.
#1. A variable name must only contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.
#2. A variable name must start with an alphabet or an underscore only. It cannot start with a digit.
#3. No white space is allowed within the variable name.
#4. A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword

# 2.What will happen if we declare a restricted keyword as a variable?
#it will throw an error because keywords cannot be used as a varible

#3Can we actually declare a string as a variable name?
# yes we can declare a string with the varible name


#4. Is it possible for us to declare “_” as a variable? If so, then write an example of it.
# No its not possible to declare "_" as a variable

#Q5. Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.
#In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means that you don’t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Instead, the type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable. This flexibility allows a variable to change its type as needed during execution.

#ex# Initial assignment
#variable = 10
# print("Initial value:", variable)
# print("Type:", type(variable))

# # Changing the type by assigning a different value
# variable = "Hello, Python!"
# print("\nAfter changing the value:")
# print("New value:", variable)
# print("Type:", type(variable))

# # Further changing the type
# variable = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# print("\nAfter changing to a list:")
# print("New value:", variable)
# print("Type:", type(variable))
